IMPORTANT
=========
- Please move "layoutmenu.sh" to somewhere on your path if you want layout button to be clickable.
- All statusbar scripts are in scripts folder. Please move whatever you want to use to your $PATH variable.
- Checkout .cfg files in statusbar for how to make/add your own files. It is pretty easy, just be sure not to use same signal for different blocks.
- Remember to add/delete your included blocks from "dwmblocks.cfg", which is the global file for blocks.
